1. Workers and managements have traditionally been adversorial. But that is changing. On the other hand, you have to remember that workers are uncomfortable when managements divert funds into other businesses or unrelated businesses, a common phenomenon in India in promoter-led companies. For example, what if a car company takes the profits earned from selling cars and reinvests into real estate or the stock market or for that matter a chain of restaurants ! This also affects the longer term prospects of the company.
2. CEOs pay themselves very high salaries in India, in proportion to the median workers' pay. This is high in countries like USA too and India has followed the US model. In India too, CEO salaries can be 500 or even 1,000 times the median. This is not the case with countries like Japan and even Germany where CEO salaries might be only 7-10 times the median. Moreover, their lifestyles are low key and not ostentatious.This increases the sense of paternalistic feeling that workers will respect in organisations in these countries and the lack of it perhaps in countries like India. Again, this becomes more critical for manufacturing and more so if you want to build a global manufacturing base in India, which in some ways is a receding target, for other reasons as well.
